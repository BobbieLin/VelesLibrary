[Veles](https://github.com/jakub-jedrusiak/VelesResearch) has a survey library designed to make studies preparation faster and easier. If you conduct psychological research, you probably want to include some standardised questionnaires or other tests. When you use a tool like MS Forms, you need to copy-paste your questionnaire for every study. Main purpose of Veles is to cut the time spent on manual tasks. Time spent on copy-pasting questionnaire items is basically wasted. The Veles Library lets you include a questionnaire like e.g. TIPI with a single command like `tipi()`.
